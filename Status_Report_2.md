## Status Report 2 ##

#### What we accomplished this week
 * Got our server for processing and storing event data up on heroku, using NodeJS and mongodb.
 * The server now receives data from the addevent form and gives a json string of all the data
 * Researched how to send emails using a heroku app (SendGrid addon)
 * Researched how to take in dates as input
 * Subscribed to various mailing lists from Tufts and used a gmail filter to find those that have free food.


#### What we planned to work on
 * Use an heroku addon to process email.
 * Forward all our emails to the newly built server and test run it.
 * Facebook integration: use event suggestions from Khuyen's facebook account.
 * Write code to parse event data from emails and Facebook events.

#### Some problems and thoughts
 - Can I (Khuyen) just use my Facebook account to get suggestions for events? Is there anyway to ask every user to login to his own Facebook account and use that data so that we have more event suggestions?
 - What are other ways to get more event suggestions?
